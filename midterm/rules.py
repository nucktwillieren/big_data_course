CHIMP_TEST_RULE = """
This test is a variant of that concept, 
that gets increasingly difficult every turn,
starting at 1 digits, and adding one every turn. 
The digits are the order you have to follow.
Once you click, the digits will be hidden.
No time limitation to remember the order.
If you pass a level, the number increases. 
If you fail, you get a strike. 
Three strikes and the test is over.
"""

VISUAL_TEST_RULE = """
Every level, a number of tiles will flash white. Memorize them, and pick them again after the tiles are reset!

Levels get progressively more difficult, to challenge your skills.

If you miss 3 tiles on a level, you lose one life.

You have three lives.

Make it as far as you can!
"""

SEQUENCE_TEST_RULE = """
Memorize the sequence of buttons that light up, then press them in order.

Every time you finish the pattern, it gets longer.

Make a mistake, you fail.

If you fail, you get a strike. 

Three strikes and the test is over.
